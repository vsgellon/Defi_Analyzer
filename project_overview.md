This application allows us to perform a comprehensive analysis of top decentralized finance projects, comparing token yields to trend in price. 

## Description: 
This application allows us to perform a comprehensive analysis of top decentralized finance projects, comparing token yields to trend in price. 

## Team Members: 
Tim Tennyson, Loc Thai, Mohammed Amine Baite, Vic Gellon

## Research Question:
What is the best Defi project to invest in depending on an investorâ€™s profile. 

## Datasets:
Data sets will be pulled from various sources and aggregators that house defi data such as Coin Gekko, Defi Llama, etc. 

## Tasks: 
Perform research on defi projects to identify 8-10 that we want to analyze, pull data from sources; clean up the data, documentation, create visualizations, create a ppt presentation, present.

### Presentation:
1. Create a definition for decentralized finance as an introducion
2. Create or find some visualizations for global defi data to show overall trends (market cap, tvl)
3. Create a short description of different categories and current use cases (lending and borrowing, decentralized exchanges, etc)
4. Create an overview of the functionality of our application

### Application
1. Select two defi projects for analysis (everyone select two)
2. Define the data we're looking for
3. Incorporate into dataframes for each project
4. Create visualizations for the data for each defi project
5. Draw conclusions for each project (provide a summary based on our findings-- good investment? bad investment?)
